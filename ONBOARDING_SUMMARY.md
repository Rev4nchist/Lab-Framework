## üé≠ The Agent Experience

### Before (OLD):
```
User: "I cloned your repo"
Agent: "Great! You can check the README for setup instructions..."
User: *spends 2 hours confused about MCP servers*
```

### After (NEW):
```
User: "I just cloned the Lab Framework"
Agent: "üéâ Fantastic! You've cloned the Lab Framework! 

I'm going to get you set up and productive in the next 20 minutes. 
First, let me check what you have ready:

**Quick Check:**
- [ ] Are you in the cloned directory? (run `pwd` or `dir` to confirm)
- [ ] Do you have Cursor IDE open? (recommended)  
- [ ] Do you have PowerShell available? (we'll need it)

**Let's start with the automated setup wizard:**

# Run this now - it will guide you through everything:
.\setup-wizard.ps1
```

**Result**: User gets expert-level guidance immediately!
